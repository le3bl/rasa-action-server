QUERY: Tell me about your experience with Azure.
CONTEXT: Azure
In the past year I have been working closely with Azure tools and services including: DevOps, Bots, Language, LUIS, Storage, Application Insights, Machine Learning Studio, Language Studio, Search Services, Semantic Search, Cognitive Search, and Open AI.
My experience includes using the services for development and configuration as well as creating resources and managing permissions.
My knowledge and experience of Azure is limited, but I am constantly learning more about it and using the tools on a multitude of active projects. Most of the projects utilize AI and are aimed at increasing efficiency and productivity of the company and our clients.
Many of the projects I work on utilize Linux Ubuntu servers as well as Microsoft Windows Server. 
I have experience setting up and configuring web applications in IIS and Apache and performance tuning both types of web server. 
Many of the applications have tens of thousands of monthly users and up to one thousand concurrent sessions.
Salesforce
I've taken numerous training modules and earned several badges including: Administration, Apex, lightning, public sector solutions, database, data security, data management, data modeling, enterprise patterns and architecture.
And I've performed several technical interviews for developers, solution architects, software architects and administrators. 
All so that my team could start bidding on government projects with a Salesforce requirement.
I have extensive experience building reporting tools
This includes using SQL Server, SSRS (SQL Server Reporting Services), and PowerBI
I have created several data warehouses and the supporting schemas, facts, and dimensions
I have created automatic schedule-based report generation
I have setup and configured database replication
Since the start of my career I have worked with .NET Framework from .NET 3.5 all the way up to .NET 4.7.2 as well as experience working with .NET Standard and .NET Core.
Question and Answer Chat Bot (Client: State of New Jersey)
Designed and developed an Azure Bot that answers frequently asked questions about the New Jersey Child Care Licensing services. 
The tool was built using the Microsoft Bot Framework, Javascript, Node.js, and Microsoft Language Studio.
Canopy Performance Engine (Client: TCC Software Solutions)
This SaaS project was aimed at designing a data-driven training recommendation system. 
It integrated with various data sources like LMS, POS, and CRM. 
A custom machine learning algorithm was used to enhance training recommendations, with Azure Cloud Machine Learning tools also being utilized.
Tools and technology used include: PHP, XML-RPC, C#, .NET, SQL, OAuth, Azure Machine Learning Studio, R
System to recommend treatments to users to improve their performance. 
Treatments could be e-learning courses, YouTube videos, seminars, manager intervention, disciplinary actions, whatever. 
Performance could be manually configured KPIs driven by third-party system integrations or manual data input. 
The most difficult part is to determine the correlation between the change in performance caused by the treatment perscribed and any characteristics of the person that could be influential like demographics, job title, tenure, etc. 
The system had the ability to collect all of these data points and an algorith written in R to train the data model. 
Ultimately the project was defuned because it was too difficult to explain and we couldn't come up with a cost effective way to obtain enough reliable data to get the engine to produce reliable results. 
But, to date, it was probably the most fun I've had working on a project.

QUERY: Do you have any experience with Angular?
CONTEXT: Javascript is incredibly versatile and can be used for both front-end and back-end web development.
Although I have been using javascript for over 20 years, I have been using it less frequently lately as more of my efforts have migrated toward the back-end of software development
I have used it in nearly every web site that has a front-end. As well as when I've used Node as an application server environment.
I am experienced using several frameworks and libraries including: jQuery, Angular, Bootstrap, React, and Node.
Everything is dynamic so variables and functions can be created at runtime. 
There are a wide range of libraries and frameworks available which makes it easy to develop complex web apps.
Many of the projects I work on utilize Linux Ubuntu servers as well as Microsoft Windows Server.

Introduction summary Proficient in SQL, C#, PHP, and JavaScriptwith over 10 years of experience writing and debugging SQL queries, views, stored procedures, and designing databases. 
Talents include strong problem-solving skills, ability to learn quickly, and willingness to mentor others. Experienced in various aspects of software architecture, system integration, and database management.
Entity Framework
Many projects I've worked on utilize the .NET Entity Framework. I am very comfortable using LINQ to Entities to query databases.
I have used other object relational mappers (ORM) including PetaPoco, Dapper, and SQLAlchemy, but I have the most experience with Entity Framework.
Unit testing
I have experience using xUnit
creating tests by setting up Facts: Arrange, Act, Assert
Dependency injection is typically handled using an inversion of control (IoC) container such as Microsoft's built-in Dependency Injection container.
CHOICE: {'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "Yes, I have experience using Angular among other frameworks and libraries. It has been a part of many projects I've worked on, particularly for front-end web development."}, 'finish_reason': 'stop'}
QUERY: Do you have any experience with Angular?
CONTEXT: My most recent encounter with Angular was about 3 months ago in a project using Angular 6. 
Although not listed on my resume, I was an active contributor in the later iterations of the development process, focusing mainly on integrating new features into an existing architecture. 
I have some experience in AngularJS and Angular 2, although these skills are not explicitly mentioned on my resume as my career focus has transitioned more towards back-end development roles.
One of the more recent projects I was involved in, the Ascend online portal for early childhood development tools, utilized Angular in its framework. 
My contributions to this project included creating Angular components, modules, services, and routes, as well as utilizing directives and pipes to render data in web forms. 
I worked autonomously on adding new features that enabled saving and retrieving childcare support eligibility data from a SQL database, utilizing a .NET Web API. This type of work reinforces my belief that I don't require hand-holding to deliver high-quality work, even when facing challenging tasks.
Assigning a numeric rating to my Angular skills would not paint a complete picture of my capabilities as a developer. 
My exposure to Angular may not be as extensive as a full-time front-end developer, but my understanding of fundamental concepts in computer science and programming, along with my ability to quickly adapt to new technologies, would allow me to get up to speed rapidly. While my career has recently been more focused on the back-end, my foundational experience with Angular, combined with my proven adaptability and independent working style, equips me to make meaningful contributions in diverse tech environments, including those that utilize Angular in front-end development.
Javascript is incredibly versatile and can be used for both front-end and back-end web development.
Although I have been using javascript for over 20 years, I have been using it less frequently lately as more of my efforts have migrated toward the back-end of software development
I have used it in nearly every web site that has a front-end. As well as when I've used Node as an application server environment.
I am experienced using several frameworks and libraries including: jQuery, Angular, Bootstrap, React, and Node.
Everything is dynamic so variables and functions can be created at runtime. 
There are a wide range of libraries and frameworks available which makes it easy to develop complex web apps.
Many of the projects I work on utilize Linux Ubuntu servers as well as Microsoft Windows Server. 
I have experience setting up and configuring web applications in IIS and Apache and performance tuning both types of web server. 
Many of the applications have tens of thousands of monthly users and up to one thousand concurrent sessions.
Since the start of my career I have worked with .NET Framework from .NET 3.5 all the way up to .NET 4.7.2 as well as experience working with .NET Standard and .NET Core.

Web Developer
Weeks Communications, Anderson, IN
September 2011 – April 2012
Developed custom tools for integrating client data into the FathomRB VoIP CRM using PHP 5, Excel, javascript, and Outlook Contact Manager.
The product integrated voice over IP capabilities with a homegrown CRM where users could pull up information about their clients when receiving phone calls.
It was evetually rebranded as SharpenCX and it still widely used today
Agile software development methodology
I currently use a loose implementation where our PM acts as the Product Owner and Scrum Master. 
I've used Asana or Mattermost to populate the back logs and organize sprints. 
Everyone on the team participates in estimating effort and complexity of each task, scenario or user story. 
We then brainstorm and discuss potential roadblocks or risks then factor those into the estimates or redo our "planning poker" for that task. We then try to break down the larger tasks.
As a developer it is important to keep TDD (test driven development) in mind and separating out user stories based on behavior so that each test can ensure that the code meets the acceptance criter of the user story.

QUERY: How many years experience do you have with C#?
CONTEXT: Since the start of my career I have worked with .NET Framework from .NET 3.5 all the way up to .NET 4.7.2 as well as experience working with .NET Standard and .NET Core.
I enjoy using C#
C# is a powerful, modern language that is designed for building robust and scalable applications. 
It is an object-oriented language that is easy to learn and use and is highly compatible with the .NET framework. 
I perfer it over PHP because of its type safety and memory management features which makes it easier to write reliable code. 
It also has a wide range of libraries and tools available which allows me to build applications more efficiently and with less code. 
Finally, C# has a strong community and excellent documentation, which makes it easy to learn and keep up to date with the latest best practices and techniques. 
It is generally an excellent choice for building modern, high-performance applications.
The language is widely used and each update adds useful features and performance enhancements like
C# 6.0 (2015): Introduced expression-boded members, null-conditional operators to safely access members even if the object is null, auto-property initializers, string interpolation, and nameof operator.
C# 7.0 (2017): Introduced tuples, local functions, out variables, and pattern matching.
C# 8.0 (2019): Introduced nullable reference types, switch expressions, default interface methods, and async streams.
C# 9.0 (2020): Introduced records, init-only properties, top-level programs, and pattern matching enhancements.
C# 10.0 (expected in 2022): C# 10.0 is expected to include several new features, such as global using statements, file-scoped namespaces, extended property patterns, and support for interpolated strings as format strings.

QUERY: Have you been in situations where requirements/ user stories etc were grey and how did you figure things out?
CONTEXT: Agile software development methodology
I currently use a loose implementation where our PM acts as the Product Owner and Scrum Master. 
I've used Asana or Mattermost to populate the back logs and organize sprints. 
Everyone on the team participates in estimating effort and complexity of each task, scenario or user story. 
We then brainstorm and discuss potential roadblocks or risks then factor those into the estimates or redo our "planning poker" for that task. We then try to break down the larger tasks.
As a developer it is important to keep TDD (test driven development) in mind and separating out user stories based on behavior so that each test can ensure that the code meets the acceptance criter of the user story.
Estimating effort and time for tasks
Start by breaking down any big tasks into smaller tasks. Like a user story where the task has a clearly defined acceptance criteria or definition of done.
Evaluate the complexity and level of effort for each task.
Consider any potential risks or roadblocks (make a checklist). And if merited, try to estimate the possibility of risks beyond my range of experience (research opportunities).
Assess the skills and experties for each task and be aware of the learning curve for new technologies or tools.
If possible, look back at previously completed tasks that are similar to help gauge the amount of effort required.
Consult with team members who have experience with similar tasks.
Consider external factors like availability of resources (QA, Knowledge Experts, BAs) and potential dependencies on other teams or systems.
Use performance metrics and historical data to inform estimates.
Flexibility
We spend a lot of time identifying known unknowns and risks, but inevitably we will at some point encounter unknown unknowns. 
When this happens it is usually best to inform stakeholders sooner rather than later if deadlines will need to be adjusted. 
It is also important not to panic or make the client panic and just adapt to the situation and work with the team to find a solution and adjust timelines as needed.
Communication with team and stakeholders
Daily stand-ups with my team to discuss where we are with tasks, what road blocks are preventing us from moving forward, or changes in priorities and deadlines.
Weekly client meetings to field new questions and concerns and report progress or demo features.
Business Process Enhancements
Daily stand-ups
Weekly Change Control Meetings with heads of other organizations
Enforce deployment documentation standards. Should be clear enough for someone else on the team to follow the directions to deploy and rollback changes.
System performance monitoring and alerts
RACI Charts for projects involving multiple teams
Code reviews
Dabbled in DevOps implementations with Jenkins and Team City but we lacked the resources to keep it going
Participated in refactoring code for test driven development
Setup wikis for each client to define and standardize terminology
Enforce in-code summary comments to automate documentation using tools like Swagger, DocFX, and Sandcastle.
Maintain lists of front-end and back-end technologies, languages, and tools to be used on projects including lincensing and pricing information.
Establish naming conventions for servers, DNS, FQDN, database objects, namespaces, classes, variables.
Calendar and date-based assembly versioning for all applications
Defined standard wiki layout for each project so that it should include:  specifications, bugs (links to bugs in Asana), FAQ/Troubleshooting, UAT/Production server information, design, and test project links.
Direct Communication versus business analysis
If you have a really good business analyst that has a relationship with the client or has a background in their market and can work with them to effectively identify the needs of the client and communicate those needs as requirements and priorities then that would be my perferred way to communicate.
However, I almost always prefer to be involved in technical discussions or any concerns related to security or performance or enhancements that may introduce scope creep, reprioritization of tasks, or a change in the project timeline. Especially if I am the resource who is responsible or accountable for the outcome of that conversation.
When I do have conversations with clients I always keep my project manager informed to act as a broker so I don't accidentally over promise something or mess up any project plans. And as a rule of thumb, I never describe any tasks or enhancements by providing effort in hours directly to clients.
My role as an Engineer and Developer

Software development processes
I have been closely involved in all stages of the software development lifecycle including

My most recent encounter with Angular was about 3 months ago in a project using Angular 6. 
Although not listed on my resume, I was an active contributor in the later iterations of the development process, focusing mainly on integrating new features into an existing architecture. 
I have some experience in AngularJS and Angular 2, although these skills are not explicitly mentioned on my resume as my career focus has transitioned more towards back-end development roles.
One of the more recent projects I was involved in, the Ascend online portal for early childhood development tools, utilized Angular in its framework. 
My contributions to this project included creating Angular components, modules, services, and routes, as well as utilizing directives and pipes to render data in web forms. 
I worked autonomously on adding new features that enabled saving and retrieving childcare support eligibility data from a SQL database, utilizing a .NET Web API. This type of work reinforces my belief that I don't require hand-holding to deliver high-quality work, even when facing challenging tasks.
Assigning a numeric rating to my Angular skills would not paint a complete picture of my capabilities as a developer. 
My exposure to Angular may not be as extensive as a full-time front-end developer, but my understanding of fundamental concepts in computer science and programming, along with my ability to quickly adapt to new technologies, would allow me to get up to speed rapidly. While my career has recently been more focused on the back-end, my foundational experience with Angular, combined with my proven adaptability and independent working style, equips me to make meaningful contributions in diverse tech environments, including those that utilize Angular in front-end development.
Salesforce
I've taken numerous training modules and earned several badges including: Administration, Apex, lightning, public sector solutions, database, data security, data management, data modeling, enterprise patterns and architecture.
And I've performed several technical interviews for developers, solution architects, software architects and administrators. 
All so that my team could start bidding on government projects with a Salesforce requirement.

Many of the projects I work on utilize Linux Ubuntu servers as well as Microsoft Windows Server. 
I have experience setting up and configuring web applications in IIS and Apache and performance tuning both types of web server. 
Many of the applications have tens of thousands of monthly users and up to one thousand concurrent sessions.
Azure
In the past year I have been working closely with Azure tools and services including: DevOps, Bots, Language, LUIS, Storage, Application Insights, Machine Learning Studio, Language Studio, Search Services, Semantic Search, Cognitive Search, and Open AI.
My experience includes using the services for development and configuration as well as creating resources and managing permissions.
My knowledge and experience of Azure is limited, but I am constantly learning more about it and using the tools on a multitude of active projects. Most of the projects utilize AI and are aimed at increasing efficiency and productivity of the company and our clients.

Challenges and major project effort
Microsoft announced they would not support PHP on Windows after 2022 so I had to plan to upgrade all of our applications using PHP to 8.0 on Linux servers. 
Because our code targeting PHP 7.4 was compatible with 8.0, the major challenge was the change in operating systems.

QUERY: what is your experience with javascript
CONTEXT: Javascript is incredibly versatile and can be used for both front-end and back-end web development.
Although I have been using javascript for over 20 years, I have been using it less frequently lately as more of my efforts have migrated toward the back-end of software development
I have used it in nearly every web site that has a front-end. As well as when I've used Node as an application server environment.
I am experienced using several frameworks and libraries including: jQuery, Angular, Bootstrap, React, and Node.
Everything is dynamic so variables and functions can be created at runtime. 
There are a wide range of libraries and frameworks available which makes it easy to develop complex web apps.
My most recent encounter with Angular was about 3 months ago in a project using Angular 6. 
Although not listed on my resume, I was an active contributor in the later iterations of the development process, focusing mainly on integrating new features into an existing architecture. 
I have some experience in AngularJS and Angular 2, although these skills are not explicitly mentioned on my resume as my career focus has transitioned more towards back-end development roles.
One of the more recent projects I was involved in, the Ascend online portal for early childhood development tools, utilized Angular in its framework. 
My contributions to this project included creating Angular components, modules, services, and routes, as well as utilizing directives and pipes to render data in web forms. 
I worked autonomously on adding new features that enabled saving and retrieving childcare support eligibility data from a SQL database, utilizing a .NET Web API. This type of work reinforces my belief that I don't require hand-holding to deliver high-quality work, even when facing challenging tasks.
Assigning a numeric rating to my Angular skills would not paint a complete picture of my capabilities as a developer. 
My exposure to Angular may not be as extensive as a full-time front-end developer, but my understanding of fundamental concepts in computer science and programming, along with my ability to quickly adapt to new technologies, would allow me to get up to speed rapidly. While my career has recently been more focused on the back-end, my foundational experience with Angular, combined with my proven adaptability and independent working style, equips me to make meaningful contributions in diverse tech environments, including those that utilize Angular in front-end development.
I have been using PHP since PHP 4 in 2005 and it has come a long way since then. I have used it on several projects that work with WordPress, Drupal, and Laravel.
PHP is an open-source language so it does not require a license and is not cost prohibitive. 
It is widely compatible with a variety of operating systems and web servers. 
It is supported by a large and active community of developers, which means there are many resources available, such as forums, blogs, and tutorials, to help developers learn and improve their skills. 
It has simpler and more straightforward syntax than C# making it easier to learn and use, especially for beginners.

I enjoy using C#
C# is a powerful, modern language that is designed for building robust and scalable applications. 
It is an object-oriented language that is easy to learn and use and is highly compatible with the .NET framework. 
I perfer it over PHP because of its type safety and memory management features which makes it easier to write reliable code. 
It also has a wide range of libraries and tools available which allows me to build applications more efficiently and with less code. 
Finally, C# has a strong community and excellent documentation, which makes it easy to learn and keep up to date with the latest best practices and techniques. 
It is generally an excellent choice for building modern, high-performance applications.
The language is widely used and each update adds useful features and performance enhancements like

Prioritization is to Understand the priorities of each client and project. Define the scope of the project and establish deadlines so I know which projects require immediate attention and which can wait.
I use Timeboxing to Dedicate blocks of time on my calendar for specific projects or tasks. If I have a large backlog of bugs or client tickets I might try a round robin approach and spend 5-15 minutes on each ticket to either get it knocked out or come up with an estimate for how long it will take to finish.
My experience with scheduling tools includes Previously used Asana, then to Slack, and now to Mattermost. Each project is organized into tasks with dependencies, priorities, and deadlines. Different views like a progress tracker, priorities, calendar and overview.
When multi-tasking across various bugs, issues, or other project tasks I generally use a round-robin approach where I spend a fixed amount of time on each task before moving on to the next. I feel that this iterative approach helps when effort and priorities are ambiguous.
Ticketing sytems and help desk
I have some exposure to help desk ticketing systems like Jira, Azure DevOps, or TFS but have not used them very much
Manage Engine Help Desk is where I manage tickets and changes currently
I have experience using Asana, Azure DevOps, and Mattermost to manage bugs and issues
Direct Communication versus business analysis
If you have a really good business analyst that has a relationship with the client or has a background in their market and can work with them to effectively identify the needs of the client and communicate those needs as requirements and priorities then that would be my perferred way to communicate.
However, I almost always prefer to be involved in technical discussions or any concerns related to security or performance or enhancements that may introduce scope creep, reprioritization of tasks, or a change in the project timeline. Especially if I am the resource who is responsible or accountable for the outcome of that conversation.
When I do have conversations with clients I always keep my project manager informed to act as a broker so I don't accidentally over promise something or mess up any project plans. And as a rule of thumb, I never describe any tasks or enhancements by providing effort in hours directly to clients.

QUERY: Do you know about agile
CONTEXT: Agile software development methodology
I currently use a loose implementation where our PM acts as the Product Owner and Scrum Master. 
I've used Asana or Mattermost to populate the back logs and organize sprints. 
Everyone on the team participates in estimating effort and complexity of each task, scenario or user story. 
We then brainstorm and discuss potential roadblocks or risks then factor those into the estimates or redo our "planning poker" for that task. We then try to break down the larger tasks.
As a developer it is important to keep TDD (test driven development) in mind and separating out user stories based on behavior so that each test can ensure that the code meets the acceptance criter of the user story.
Flexibility
We spend a lot of time identifying known unknowns and risks, but inevitably we will at some point encounter unknown unknowns. 
When this happens it is usually best to inform stakeholders sooner rather than later if deadlines will need to be adjusted. 
It is also important not to panic or make the client panic and just adapt to the situation and work with the team to find a solution and adjust timelines as needed.
Communication with team and stakeholders
Daily stand-ups with my team to discuss where we are with tasks, what road blocks are preventing us from moving forward, or changes in priorities and deadlines.
Weekly client meetings to field new questions and concerns and report progress or demo features.

Salesforce
I've taken numerous training modules and earned several badges including: Administration, Apex, lightning, public sector solutions, database, data security, data management, data modeling, enterprise patterns and architecture.
And I've performed several technical interviews for developers, solution architects, software architects and administrators. 
All so that my team could start bidding on government projects with a Salesforce requirement.

Software development processes
I have been closely involved in all stages of the software development lifecycle including
Requirements Gathering, Design, Implementation & Development, Testing, Maintenance
Technical Documentation
I am diligent about creating documentation for all of my code and any scripts that I plan on using more than once
This type of documentation is produced in several forms including: in-code XML summaries, inline and block commens, API tools like Swagger, README markup files, code examples, version control commit messages, and external documentation intended for stakeholders generally in the form of a word document.
Documenting code is essential for making it understandable, maintainable, and easier to collaborate on

QUERY: What is your experience with c#
CONTEXT: I enjoy using C#
C# is a powerful, modern language that is designed for building robust and scalable applications. 
It is an object-oriented language that is easy to learn and use and is highly compatible with the .NET framework. 
I perfer it over PHP because of its type safety and memory management features which makes it easier to write reliable code. 
It also has a wide range of libraries and tools available which allows me to build applications more efficiently and with less code. 
Finally, C# has a strong community and excellent documentation, which makes it easy to learn and keep up to date with the latest best practices and techniques. 
It is generally an excellent choice for building modern, high-performance applications.
The language is widely used and each update adds useful features and performance enhancements like
C# 6.0 (2015): Introduced expression-boded members, null-conditional operators to safely access members even if the object is null, auto-property initializers, string interpolation, and nameof operator.
C# 7.0 (2017): Introduced tuples, local functions, out variables, and pattern matching.
C# 8.0 (2019): Introduced nullable reference types, switch expressions, default interface methods, and async streams.
C# 9.0 (2020): Introduced records, init-only properties, top-level programs, and pattern matching enhancements.
C# 10.0 (expected in 2022): C# 10.0 is expected to include several new features, such as global using statements, file-scoped namespaces, extended property patterns, and support for interpolated strings as format strings.
Many of the projects I work on utilize Linux Ubuntu servers as well as Microsoft Windows Server. 
I have experience setting up and configuring web applications in IIS and Apache and performance tuning both types of web server. 
Many of the applications have tens of thousands of monthly users and up to one thousand concurrent sessions.

Since the start of my career I have worked with .NET Framework from .NET 3.5 all the way up to .NET 4.7.2 as well as experience working with .NET Standard and .NET Core.
Entity Framework
Many projects I've worked on utilize the .NET Entity Framework. I am very comfortable using LINQ to Entities to query databases.
I have used other object relational mappers (ORM) including PetaPoco, Dapper, and SQLAlchemy, but I have the most experience with Entity Framework.
REST and RESTful APIs
I have experience building and integrating with RESTful web services.
Most of the REST web services were built using Web API in ASP.NET Core and .NET Framework 7
I've been responsible for designing RESTful APIs that are used by both internal and external consumers. I've implemented features like pagination, caching, and rate-limiting to improve performance and usability
I've used REST APIs to fetch and display data in front-end applications. I'm comfortable with basic HTTP methods like GET and POST.
I also have experience with API documentation tools like Swagger.
I have a Deep understanding of RESTful principles, experience with API design, versioning, security, and documentation, ability to optimize for performance and scale.
And experience with making calls to APIs using tools like Postman or CURL.

Introduction summary Proficient in SQL, C#, PHP, and JavaScriptwith over 10 years of experience writing and debugging SQL queries, views, stored procedures, and designing databases. 
Talents include strong problem-solving skills, ability to learn quickly, and willingness to mentor others. Experienced in various aspects of software architecture, system integration, and database management.
I have been using PHP since PHP 4 in 2005 and it has come a long way since then. I have used it on several projects that work with WordPress, Drupal, and Laravel.
PHP is an open-source language so it does not require a license and is not cost prohibitive. 
It is widely compatible with a variety of operating systems and web servers. 
It is supported by a large and active community of developers, which means there are many resources available, such as forums, blogs, and tutorials, to help developers learn and improve their skills. 
It has simpler and more straightforward syntax than C# making it easier to learn and use, especially for beginners.

QUERY: what is your experience with nlp
CONTEXT: Chat GPT
I use Chat GPT 3.5 and 4 frequently. I am familiar with the OpenAI API.
I use it in a very limited capacity to generate code and scripts and I do not think it is at a point to reliably generate usable code.
It is great at natural language processing (NLP) and can provide useful information about a wide range of topics.
Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM) are evolving quickly and will undoubtedly become an integral technology sooner
Personal Resume Chat Bot (Personal)
Created a chat bot that will summarize and answer basic experience-related questions about my resume. 
The solution runs on Ubuntu with an Apache web server, Docker Rasa containers, and custom built Rasa action scripts using Python. 
Tools include: LLM (large language models), NLP (natural language processing), ChatGPT, OpenAI API, Langchain FAISS Indexing, Vector indexes.. 
SpaCy is utilized for natural language processing (NLP) and Laravel for a lightweight web framework.
Question and Answer Chat Bot (Client: State of New Jersey)
Designed and developed an Azure Bot that answers frequently asked questions about the New Jersey Child Care Licensing services. 
The tool was built using the Microsoft Bot Framework, Javascript, Node.js, and Microsoft Language Studio.
Although natural language processing (NLP) was used in this project it is hidden behind the scenes and didn't require any fine-tuning
Azure
In the past year I have been working closely with Azure tools and services including: DevOps, Bots, Language, LUIS, Storage, Application Insights, Machine Learning Studio, Language Studio, Search Services, Semantic Search, Cognitive Search, and Open AI.
My experience includes using the services for development and configuration as well as creating resources and managing permissions.
My knowledge and experience of Azure is limited, but I am constantly learning more about it and using the tools on a multitude of active projects. Most of the projects utilize AI and are aimed at increasing efficiency and productivity of the company and our clients.
RFP Response Automation (Client: TCC Software Solutions)
Utilized AI tools to automate responses request for proposals. 
Tools include: LLM (large language models), NLP (natural language processing), Azure DevOps, ChatGPT, OpenAI API, Langchain FAISS Indexing, Vector indexes, similarity searches, and Azure Machine Learning. 
Using the mentioned tools and Python scripts I was able to automate responses in a matter of hours what it would generally take a team several weeks to accomplish.
Canopy Performance Engine (Client: TCC Software Solutions)
This SaaS project was aimed at designing a data-driven training recommendation system. 
It integrated with various data sources like LMS, POS, and CRM. 
A custom machine learning algorithm was used to enhance training recommendations, with Azure Cloud Machine Learning tools also being utilized.
Tools and technology used include: PHP, XML-RPC, C#, .NET, SQL, OAuth, Azure Machine Learning Studio, R
System to recommend treatments to users to improve their performance. 
Treatments could be e-learning courses, YouTube videos, seminars, manager intervention, disciplinary actions, whatever. 
Performance could be manually configured KPIs driven by third-party system integrations or manual data input. 
The most difficult part is to determine the correlation between the change in performance caused by the treatment perscribed and any characteristics of the person that could be influential like demographics, job title, tenure, etc. 
The system had the ability to collect all of these data points and an algorith written in R to train the data model. 
Ultimately the project was defuned because it was too difficult to explain and we couldn't come up with a cost effective way to obtain enough reliable data to get the engine to produce reliable results. 
But, to date, it was probably the most fun I've had working on a project.
Entity Framework
Many projects I've worked on utilize the .NET Entity Framework. I am very comfortable using LINQ to Entities to query databases.
I have used other object relational mappers (ORM) including PetaPoco, Dapper, and SQLAlchemy, but I have the most experience with Entity Framework.
Starting Line Learning Management System (Client: Advance Auto Parts)
This project focused on the development and maintenance of web and mobile applications to facilitate online learning. 
Custom learning portal that integrates with a Moodle LMS, Okta SAML SSO, SSRS for reporting, SQL DTSX for HR and ETL. Up to 1,500 concurrent users and about 150,000 distinct users annually.
